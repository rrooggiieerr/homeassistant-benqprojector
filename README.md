## Introduction

A Home Assistant integration to control BenQ projectors via the serial or network interface
including serial to network bridges such as [esp-link](https://github.com/jeelabs/esp-link).

## Features

* Connects to a BenQ projector over serial or network interface
* Sending commands to projectors
* Reading the projector status
* Uses asynchronous IO

## Protocol

BenQ projectors and flat panels with a serial port can support one of three protocols. This
integration supports BenQ projectors in the L, P, T, W and X series, and likely others.

This integration works if your projector supports the following command structure:

```
<CR>*<key>=<value>#<CR>
```

Where `<CR>` is a Carriage Return

Examples:  
Power on   : `<CR>*pow=on#<CR>`  
Power off  : `<CR>*pow=off#<CR>`  
Change source to HDMI: `<CR>*sour=hdmi#<CR>`  

### PJLink

This integration does **not** implement the PJLink protocol, but a proprietary BenQ protocol
instead. The PJLink protocol is covered by it's own [PJLink integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/pjlink/).

## Hardware

### Serial port

I'm using a generic serial to USB converter to connect to my projector. The projector has a male
DB9 connector, thus you need a female connector on your USB converter.

You can look up and change the baud rate in the menu of your BenQ projector.

### Network connected projectors

The commands as described above also work over a network connection. Although I don't own such a
projector I have implemented the network functionality using a serial to WiFi bridge. The network
support for integrated networked BenQ projectors is thus experimental. Let me know if your network
connected BenQ projector works.

Example of a serial to WiFi bridge using a serial to TTL converter and a Wemos C3 Mini:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rrooggiieerr/homeassistant-benqprojector/main/serial%20to%20network%20bridge.png" style="width: 25%;"/>

It has to be said that a direct serial connection to the projector is much more responsive than
using a serial to WiFi bridge. Maybe this is different on an integrated networked BenQ projector or
using ethernet instead of WiFi.

## Supported projectors

The following projectors are known to work:

* HT4550i
* MS521P
* MW519
* TH585
* TK800m
* W600L
* W1070
* W1100
* W1110
* W1140
* W1250
* W4000i
* W4100i
* X3000i

The following projectors are not tested but use the same protocol according to the documentation:

Others in the L, P, T, W and X Series

Not supported:

* RP552
* RP552H
* RP840G
* RP653
* RP703
* RP750
* RP750K
* RP652
* RP702
* RP790S
* RP705H

Please let me know if your projector is also supported by this Home Assistant integration so I can
improve the overview of supported projectors.

## Installation

### HACS

The recommended way to install this Home Assistant integration is by using [HACS][hacs].
Click the following button to open the integration directly on the HACS integration page.

[![Install BenQ projector from HACS.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=rrooggiieerr&repository=homeassistant-benqprojector&category=integration)

Or follow these instructions:

- Go to your **HACS** view in Home Assistant and then to **Integrations**
- Select **+ Explore & download repositories** and search for *BenQ Projector*
- Select **Download**
- Restart Home Assistant

### Manually

- Copy the `custom_components/benqprojector` directory of this repository into the
`config/custom_components/` directory of your Home Assistant installation
- Restart Home Assistant

## Adding a new BenQ projector

- After restarting go to **Settings** then **Devices & Services**
- Select **+ Add integration** and type in *BenQ Projector*
- Select the serial port or enter the path manually
- Enter the baud rate
- Select **Submit**

When your wiring is right a new BenQ Projector integration and device will now be added to your
Integrations view. If your wiring is not right you will get a *Failed to connect* error message.

Some projectors need to be **powered on** to be able to detect the model and the integration to work.

## Actions

The integration supports actions so commands can be send which are (not yet) implemented.

`benqprojector.send` This action allows you to send commands with or withouth action to your BenQ
Projector. To get the current state of a setting use `?` as the action.

```
action: benqprojector.send
data:
  device_id: 1481637509cb0c89ea1582e195fe6370
  command: "pow"
  action: "?"
```

`benqprojector.send_raw` This action allows you to send any raw command to your BenQ Projector. The
command needs to include the `*` and `#` prefix and suffix.

```
action: benqprojector.send_raw
data:
  device_id: 1481637509cb0c89ea1582e195fe6370
  command: "*pow=?#"
```

## Contribution and appreciation

You can contribute to this integration, or show your appreciation, in the following ways.

### Contribute your language

If you would like to use this Home Assistant integration in your own language you can provide a
translation file as found in the `custom_components/benqprojector/translations` directory. Create a
pull request (preferred) or issue with the file for your language attached.

More on translating custom integrations can be found
[here](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/internationalization/custom_integration/).

### Contribute your projector model configuration

For increased support of your specific BenQ projector model you can contribute the configuration of
your projector to the underlaying [BenQ projector library](https://github.com/rrooggiieerr/benqprojector.py)

Follow [these instruction](https://github.com/rrooggiieerr/benqprojector.py#detecting-your-projector-capabilities)
on how to do so.
